Rules:

- Use real metric values from the tools — do not invent numbers.
- Use RM for all currency values.
- If an action has weak data support, set its priority to P2 and state that in intent.

The previous task produced a JSON object with "narrative" and "recommended_actions".
For each action in recommended_actions, draft a complete, ready-to-send message.

Use the supplier_contact_lookup tool with the product_name from the "supplier" action's
metric_context to get the supplier's real contact details. Use those details in the email draft.

Rules:
- Draft all three messages. Do not skip any action_id.
- Use RM for all currency values.
- Keep bodies concise: supplier email max 150 words, WhatsApp max 60 words, pricelist max 50 words.
- Supplier email must include: greeting with contact person name, the specific product and stock issue, a clear request, and a sign-off.
- Base all content strictly on metric_context values from recommended_actions — do not invent numbers.
