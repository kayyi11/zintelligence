## 📖 Project Description

### Summary

Z-intelligence is a full-stack decision intelligence platform built for small and medium businesses. It closes the gap between data and action — ingesting raw business data, surfacing AI-generated insights, and enabling one-click execution of strategic decisions through a multi-agent AI backbone.

Rather than simply showing dashboards, Z-intelligence actively **advises, drafts, and acts**: generating supplier emails, price adjustment plans, inventory alerts, and business reports — all from a conversational interface.

### Problem Statement

Small and medium businesses face a critical gap between the **data they collect** and the **decisions they need to make**.

- **The Pain Point**: Most SMBs lack dedicated analysts or BI tools. Business owners are drowning in raw data — sales figures, inventory counts, supplier invoices — with no clear path from numbers to action.
- **The Impact**: Poor decisions made on gut instinct rather than data lead to overstocking, missed revenue opportunities, and slow responses to market shifts. Meanwhile, enterprise-grade BI tools are priced out of reach.

Z-intelligence democratises decision intelligence by combining multi-agent AI, real-time Firestore data, and a conversational interface purpose-built for SMB operators.

### SDGs Addressed

- **SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth**
  - Empowers SMB owners with AI-driven strategic tools previously only accessible to large enterprises, strengthening local economic resilience.
- **SDG 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure**
  - Accelerates the adoption of AI and data infrastructure in small businesses, bridging the digital divide between SMBs and large corporations.

## 🔑 Key AI Capabilities

- **Automated Insight Generation** — Gemini analyses Firestore business data weekly to surface revenue trends, anomalies, and opportunities without manual prompting.
- **Multi-Agent Strategic Advice** — A CrewAI crew of specialised agents (analyst, strategist, communicator) collaborates to produce contextualised recommendations with supporting evidence.
- **Smart Draft Communications** — AI generates ready-to-send supplier emails and internal updates based on live business context, drastically reducing administrative overhead.
- **Ilmu GLM Integration** — Malaysian-context language model (ilmu-glm-5.1) ensures recommendations are culturally and commercially relevant for local SMBs.
- **On-Demand Report Generation** — Full business summaries and category-specific reports generated and rendered in-browser on demand.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- Python ≥ 3.10
- A Firebase project with Firestore enabled
- API keys for **Google Gemini** and **Ilmu GLM** (see [API Keys](#-api-keys))

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/z-intelligence.git
cd z-intelligence
```

### 2. Firebase Setup

Place your Firebase service account JSON at:

```
backend/serviceAccountKey.json
```

Then deploy Firestore rules:

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

**Root `.env`** (used by seed scripts):

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
ZAI_API_KEY=your_ilmu_glm_api_key
ZAI_API_BASE=https://your_ilmu_api_base_url
ZAI_MODEL_NAME=ilmu-glm-5.1
```

**`backend/.env`**:

```env
ZAI_API_KEY=your_ilmu_glm_api_key
ZAI_API_BASE=https://your_ilmu_api_base_url
ZAI_MODEL_NAME=ilmu-glm-5.1
```

**`frontend/.env`**:

```env
VITE_DEMO_MODE=true
```

> ⚠️ Never commit `.env` or any file containing real API keys.

### 4. Seed the Database (optional)

Populate Firestore with sample business data:

```bash
npm install
node seed.js
```

### 5. Run the Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Backend runs at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 6. Run the Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🔐 API Keys

The two external LLM services used by Z-intelligence are **not publicly available**:

- **Google Gemini** — requires a Google AI Studio or Google Cloud account with Gemini API access enabled.
- **Ilmu GLM (`ilmu.ai`)** — a Malaysian-context language model. Access is granted directly by the ilmu.ai team.

To run all AI features locally, valid credentials for both services are required.

---

## ⚔️ Challenges Faced

- **Multi-agent Coordination**: Orchestrating CrewAI agents with different specialisations (analysis, strategy, communication) while maintaining coherent, non-contradictory outputs required careful prompt design and output chaining.

- **LLM Context Alignment**: Ilmu GLM's Malaysian business context required custom prompt templates to ensure recommendations were relevant to local SMB operating conditions (e.g. local supplier dynamics, ringgit-denominated pricing).

- **Real-time Data Freshness**: Balancing Firestore read costs against the need for up-to-date insight generation led us to implement a hybrid approach — live data for dashboards, scheduled batch jobs for weekly AI insights.

- **SMB Data Quality**: Raw data uploaded by SMB users is often inconsistent or incomplete. The Data Workspace's inline AI extraction was built specifically to handle and normalise messy real-world input formats.

---

## 🛣️ Future Roadmap

**Short-term (0–6 months): Live Integrations & Data Accuracy**
- Connect the Revenue Dashboard to live POS and e-commerce data streams via webhook ingestion into Firestore.
- Introduce confidence scoring on AI insights so users can gauge reliability before acting.

**Medium-term (6–12 months): Collaborative Decision-Making**
- Add team roles and permission levels, allowing multiple stakeholders (owner, manager, finance) to collaborate on decision tracking.
- Implement push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging to alert team members when high-priority AI recommendations are generated.

**Long-term (12+ months): Industry Vertical Expansion**
- Extend Ilmu GLM prompt templates for vertical-specific SMB contexts: F&B, retail, logistics, and professional services.
- Build a supplier integration layer enabling Z-intelligence to autonomously draft and track purchase orders upon decision approval.
